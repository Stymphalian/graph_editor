# Testing Mouse-Following NodeNibs

## Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented mouse-following behavior for NodeNibs in the graph editor. Here's what was implemented:

### Features Added:
1. **Dynamic Nib Positioning**: NodeNibs now position themselves on the circumference of selected nodes based on the mouse cursor position
2. **Smooth Transitions**: Added CSS transitions for smooth movement as the mouse moves around the node
3. **Real-time Updates**: Mouse position is tracked continuously and nib positions update in real-time
4. **Polar Coordinate System**: Nibs use angle calculations to position themselves correctly around the node circumference

### Technical Changes:

#### Node.tsx:
- Modified `applyNodeNibs()` function to accept mouse position and node position parameters
- Added angle calculation using `Math.atan2()` to determine nib position
- Implemented polar coordinate positioning with `Math.cos()` and `Math.sin()`
- Added smooth CSS transitions for position changes

#### GraphViewer.tsx:
- Extended mouse tracking to work for all selected nodes, not just edge creation mode
- Added `updateNibPositions()` function to update nib positions in real-time
- Updated all `applyNodeNibs()` calls to pass mouse and node position data
- Added proper null checking for TypeScript compliance

### How to Test:
1. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Open the graph editor in your browser
3. Create some nodes by clicking in empty space (edit mode)
4. Select a node by clicking on it
5. Move your mouse around the selected node
6. Observe how the NodeNib (small black circle) follows your mouse position around the node's circumference

The nib will:
- Position itself on the circumference closest to your mouse cursor
- Rotate smoothly as you move the mouse around the node
- Maintain proper distance from the node edge
- Transition smoothly with CSS animations

All existing functionality (clicking nibs to create edges, hover effects, etc.) remains intact.
