- line edge weights should be smart about placing to the left or right of the line.
- errro messages should be in the GraphViewer component. Don't pass through props.
  pass in a function which validates if a label is okay.
- node dragging still causes the simulatin to run
- text-area with line numbers and with scrollbar. Scrollbar not working.
- Tune the force strengths and lengths to make it look nice.
- Adjust the new node placement logic when creating new nodes form text-representation
- View-force mode and node drag causes the nodes to get stuck in position. probably a stale react state issue.
- fix the useEffect dependencies for GraphViewer. it is too complicated and there are way-too many re-renders
  it breaks some functionality which I only want triggered for a few things.
