- The Graph.Node should not have x,y information. It is not apart of the structure.
  Only the viewer needs to know about that information.
- selectedNode/selectedEdge causes the GraphViewer component to refresh which kills/recreates the entire SVG screen. don't do this.
- preview line does not work with zooming
- clicking on selected node does not cause deselection.
