# Chat Summary: Graph Editor - Core Data Model Implementation

## Project Overview
Successfully completed Task 2.0 "Core Graph Data Model Implementation" for a web-based graph editor project. Built a comprehensive TypeScript-based graph data model with full CRUD operations, validation, serialization, and extensive testing.

## Key Requirements/Decisions
- Implement Graph class as single source of truth for graph data management
- Support both directed and undirected graph modes with type conversion
- Create flexible node labeling system (0-indexed, 1-indexed, custom strings)
- Add edge weight support as string values with validation
- Implement graph validation with 15+ constraint checks
- Create simple text format serialization/parsing (edge-list style)
- Maintain full TypeScript type safety with strict settings
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage

## Deliverables Created
1. **`graph_editor/src/types/graph.ts`**: TypeScript interfaces for Node, Edge, GraphData, GraphState, and validation types
2. **`graph_editor/src/models/Graph.ts`**: Core Graph class with 50+ methods for complete graph management
3. **`graph_editor/src/models/Graph.test.ts`**: Comprehensive test suite with 238 unit tests covering all functionality
4. **`graph_editor/src/types/graph.test.ts`**: Type validation tests for all interfaces
5. **`.ai/tasks/tasks-prd-graph-editor.md`**: Updated task tracking with Task 2.0 marked complete

## Implementation Approach
- Iterative development with test-driven approach
- User feedback integration for feature refinement and simplification
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive validation and error handling
- Round-trip serialization/parsing for data integrity
- Extensive test coverage including edge cases and error scenarios

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with Task 3.0 "Graph Visualization System (D3.js Integration)" which includes:
- GraphViewer component with SVG container setup
- D3.js data binding for nodes and edges rendering
- Node and Edge visual components
- Interactive features like selection and edge creation
- Responsive scaling and viewport management

All 266 tests passing, git committed, and core data model fully functional.
