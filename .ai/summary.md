# Chat Summary: Web-Based Graph Editor Project Setup

## Project Overview
Completed the initial setup and configuration phase for a web-based graph editor application built with React, TypeScript, D3.js, and Vite. The project is designed to create and manipulate graphs with nodes and edges, featuring both visual and text-based editing capabilities.

## Key Requirements/Decisions
- React 19.1.1 with TypeScript 5.9.2 for type safety
- D3.js 7.9.0 for graph visualization and force simulation
- Vite 7.1.4 as build tool with hot module replacement
- Tailwind CSS 4.1.13 for styling
- Jest 30.1.3 with React Testing Library 16.3.0 for testing
- ESLint 9.34.0 with Prettier for code quality and formatting
- Support for both directed and undirected graphs
- Node labeling system (0-indexed, 1-indexed, custom strings)
- Edge weight support and force simulation layout

## Deliverables Created
1. **Project Structure**: Complete src/ directory with components, hooks, models, utils, types, context, and styles folders
2. **ESLint Configuration**: `.eslintrc.cjs` with TypeScript, React, and Prettier integration
3. **Prettier Configuration**: `.prettierrc` and `.prettierignore` for consistent code formatting
4. **Package.json Scripts**: Comprehensive development, build, testing, and validation scripts
5. **TypeScript Configuration**: Strict settings with path aliases and proper module resolution
6. **Jest Configuration**: Testing setup with React Testing Library and coverage reporting
7. **Vite Configuration**: Build setup with React plugin and development server
8. **Tailwind Configuration**: CSS framework setup for graph editor styling

## Implementation Approach
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- TypeScript-first development with strict type checking
- Component-based React architecture with custom hooks
- D3.js integration for SVG-based graph visualization
- Comprehensive testing strategy with unit and integration tests
- Code quality enforcement through ESLint and Prettier
- Development workflow with hot reloading and automated validation

## Next Steps
Ready to begin Task 2.0 "Core Graph Data Model Implementation":
- Define TypeScript interfaces for Node, Edge, and Graph data structures
- Implement Graph class as single source of truth for graph data
- Add methods for node and edge management
- Implement graph validation and constraint checking
- Add support for directed/undirected graph modes and node labeling

The project foundation is complete with all development tools configured and tested. The next phase will focus on implementing the core graph data model and business logic.
