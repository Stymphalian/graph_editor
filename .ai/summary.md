# Chat Summary: Graph Editor - Square Aspect Ratio and Responsive Resizing

## Project Overview
Implemented square aspect ratio constraint for the D3.js graph viewer with responsive resizing capabilities. The viewer now maintains a 1:1 aspect ratio while being fully responsive and preserving graph state during viewport changes.

## Key Requirements/Decisions
- Graph viewer must maintain square aspect ratio (1:1) during all resizes
- Minimum size constraint of 300px must be enforced
- Resizing should not destroy currently rendered graph (zoom, pan, node positions preserved)
- Parent container border styling removed for cleaner appearance
- Square viewer should be centered within its container

## Deliverables Created
1. **GraphViewer.tsx**: Enhanced with square aspect ratio logic, responsive resizing, and state preservation
2. **App.tsx**: Updated to remove parent container border styling
3. **d3Config.ts**: Maintained existing force simulation configuration
4. **globals.css**: Preserved existing CSS without additional constraints

## Implementation Approach
- Square dimensions calculated based on smaller container dimension
- Resize handling directly updates SVG dimensions and simulation center force
- Zoom transform preserved and restored after resize operations
- Container uses flexbox centering for square viewer positioning
- Minimum size enforced in JavaScript resize logic

## Next Steps
Ready to begin Task 4.0 "Text Panel and Data Synchronization" - specifically Task 4.1 "Create TextPanel component with textarea for graph data display". The graph visualization system is complete with square aspect ratio and responsive behavior.
