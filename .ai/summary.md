# Chat Summary: Graph Editor Event Propagation and Conflict Resolution (Task 5.10)

## Project Overview
Successfully implemented proper event propagation and conflict resolution for the graph editor application. This involved resolving conflicts between drag operations and click events, implementing reliable double-click detection, and adding mode-specific event priority handling to prevent unexpected user interactions.

## Key Requirements/Decisions
- Resolve drag vs click conflicts to prevent accidental actions when dragging nodes
- Implement timeout-based click handling for proper double-click detection (200ms delay)
- Add mode-specific event priority system (edit/delete/view-force modes)
- Enhance drag behavior with proper event.stopPropagation() calls
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Ensure all tests pass with new async event handling

## Deliverables Created
1. **d3Config.ts**: Enhanced drag behavior with event propagation control
2. **Node.tsx**: Added timeout-based click handling and drag detection
3. **Edge.tsx**: Added timeout-based click handling for double-click detection
4. **GraphViewer.tsx**: Added shouldProcessEvent() helper for mode-aware event handling
5. **Node.test.tsx**: Updated tests to handle new async click behavior
6. **Edge.test.tsx**: Updated tests to handle new async click behavior
7. **tasks-prd-graph-editor.md**: Marked Task 5.10 as completed

## Implementation Approach
- Used timeout-based approach (200ms) to distinguish single-clicks from double-clicks
- Implemented event.stopPropagation() in drag handlers to prevent click events after dragging
- Created shouldProcessEvent() helper function to determine event processing based on current mode
- Added drag detection flags to prevent click events when dragging has occurred
- Updated existing tests to use async/await pattern for timeout-based event handling
- Maintained all existing functionality while adding robust conflict resolution

## Next Steps
- Task 5.10 is complete and committed (commit 63c6691)
- Ready to proceed with Task 5.11 (keyboard event handling for mode switching) or move to Section 6.0 (Mode Management and Controls)
- All 96 tests passing with robust event handling system in place
- Graph editor now has professional-grade event handling with proper conflict resolution
